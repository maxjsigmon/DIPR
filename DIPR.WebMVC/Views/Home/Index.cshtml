    <p class="lead">DIPR was designed with new parents in mind. The first few days of your newborn's life on this side of the womb can be hectic. Your doctor likely wants as much information on your baby as you can possibly give to ensure they are adjusting properly. We here at DIPR want to make sure you're able to track all that vital data without having to get a pen and find that chart where your spouse left who knows where! We've got it all right in the palm of your hand. Spend less time tracking and more with your baby. </p>
