# DIPR

### Azure Deployment
- [DIPR Azure](https://diprapp.azurewebsites.net/)

### The Concept
The goal was to design an application for parents of newborns, so they can track feedings, sleep, and diapers to then be able to report that data to their doctor. 

### Main Functionality
- Add a baby and report basic data, like birthdate, and add any notes for that child.
- Create, view, update and delete data on the health indicators for the baby, such as bottle feeding, nursing data, sleep data, and diaper data.

### Future Plans
- Create a page that displays all data for a baby and then be able to quickly send that data to the users doctor.
- Baby 101 blog

### How to get it running

```sh
https://github.com/maxjsigmon/DIPR.git

- Open Git Bash (Or Command Line Window)
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier
